                        Please, let me introduce this not noob anymore, probably, italian guy.
                        <br/>
                        He is a passionate software engineer with the strong belief the web is the right solution for every kind of business or simple need. 
                        For this reason he focused his experience in web development with no racism against different programming languages, on the contrary always ready to fall into a new one.
                        <br/>
                        He has served as software engineer for different sectors where he improved his development skills and technologies knowledge about health, gaming, betting and mainly publishing.
                        <br/>
                        He gained more than 7 years experience in system development and implementation of small, medium and large software projects. 
                        He used to work under pressure daily, especially during the betting and gambling sector with on-call availability, 24 seven considering poker and casino are like money, they never sleep.
                        <br/><br/>
                        That's enough of talking in the third person.
                        <br/><br/>
                        At first I intended to be a surveyor and went to school fully motivated to become just that. One thing led to another and 5 years went by and I was a (almost) fully fledged site manager 
                        without ever planning to design concrete structures. I realised that the most exciting part revolved around the concept of "create something with that magical box called pc" and so I decided to enrol at university.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This fortunate turn of events has lead me to realise websites for such people as L'Espresso group, BellMedia, Atex, Repubblica.it, IziPlay, Enav and SunPower. To work with people from all over the world is very rewarding. 
                        Italy, Sweden, Spain, Germany, England, Malaysia and Canada are some of the countries I have worked with. Well not the country itself, but people living there.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I have coded projects with great respect to standards, because it makes life easier for everybody. Oh yes, I am pretty good on both frontend and backend side but css makes me so quick tempered! 
                        <br/>
                        What skills do I have? Honestly I felt so proud when the colleagues of mine chose the following ones:
                        <br/>
                        - Reliability
                        <br/>
                        - Positivity
                        <br/>
                        - Team work attitude
                        <br/><br/>
                    </p>

                    <p class="drop-cap">
                        I have a lovely girlfriend who followed me in Stockholm for this new life experience. 
                        <br/>
                        I spent more than 30 years in Italy where I was born and left my best friends and family, God save Skype and FaceTime!
